# PKI Cloud Solution - Moiz and Ramsey
This is our cloud security project for COSC 55 Summer 24. Moiz and I have successfully deployed a one-tier PKI for a small organization hosting two internal webservers. The Certificate Authority is an EC2 Ubuntu instance in a private subnet that distributes SSL certificates to the organization's EC2 webservers in public subnets across two availbility zones.

From the Wiki:
* [Here](https://github.com/RamseyW2004/cosc55project/wiki/Functional-PKI-Deployment-Guide) is a guide to deploy the PKI.
* [Here](https://github.com/RamseyW2004/cosc55project/wiki/Functional-Cloud-Deployment-Guide) is a guide to deploy the cloud environment in AWS.
* [Here](https://github.com/RamseyW2004/cosc55project/wiki/System-Deployment-Plan) is an abstract system deployment plan.
